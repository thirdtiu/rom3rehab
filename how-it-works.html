                <h2 class="media-heading">How It Works</h2>
                <p>The ROM³ Rehab System involves a patented adjustable pedal system (X-Y Technology™) which enables patients with any lower extremity Range of Motion to immediately begin movement within a limited Range of Motion of the affected joint or limb.</p>
                <p>Patients, including those with extremely limited ROM, can comfortably begin at the lowest gradients of movement—with passive motion, in a miniscule Range of Motion. Within 7-10 minutes, therapists observe that the affected leg relaxes and begins comfortable exertion, reaching assisted-active motion, and causing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Improved blood flow and lymphatic flow
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduced swelling
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduced pain
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>A key dynamic of the ROM³ System is that a patient uses his/her “good leg” to push, stretch, and rehabilitate his/her “bad leg.” A subtle ingenuity is that the patient now plays both sides of the “chess game”—that is to say, the patient becomes a co-therapist by supervising his “good leg” to support and stretch his own “bad leg.” Thus the patient unconsciously adopts the viewpoint of a therapist, rather than that of a protester, and so better drives—and speeds—his/her own recovery. The difference is subtle, but the results are remarkable.</p>
                <p>As time goes on, patients can gradually increase to active motions, and adjust the device for greater and greater Range of Motion.</p>
                <p>The ROM³ System’s universal accessibility and ease of use enables both earlier movement and more movement, allowing the patient’s natural recovery mechanisms to flourish which aids the recovery and healing process.</p>
                <p>Rehabilitating Sit-to-Stand Motions
                    <br> The ROM³ System can also be used to rehabilitate Sit-to-Stand motions, which are so vital to functional independence and the activities of daily living. (read more) [link to Sit-to-Stand page]</p>
                <p>
                    Rehabilitating More Advanced Gaits
                    <br> The versatile ROM³ System can also be adjusted to rehabilitate other Advanced Gaits, which help patients with everyday actions, such as climbing stairs, walking on uneven surfaces or grass, or taking a diagonal step, further increasing patients’ functional independence.
                </p>
                <p>To accomplish this, the ROM³'s pedal positions are adjusted offset such that when one pedal is up, the other is forward (90° offset), known as "Leading Leg Technology™".</p>
                <p>These motions are different from walking in straight lines on level, even surfaces, and require a different sequence of muscle recruitment. In these types of everyday motions, patients usually lead with their “good leg” with the affected leg trailing. </p>
                <p>Advanced Gait Therapy with the ROM³ System rehabilitates these more advanced motions necessary for activities of daily living, further improving patient mobility, functionality, and independence.</p>
